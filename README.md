A rapid development challenge where I attempted to recreate the essence of the cult classic game "Super Hexagon" in just 30 minutes using Unity and WebGL.

Opjective:

As the small triangle near the center, avoid colliding with the encroaching walls and survive as long as possible.

Controls:

Left Arrow Key/A = Rotate Left

Right Arrow Key/D = Rotate Right
